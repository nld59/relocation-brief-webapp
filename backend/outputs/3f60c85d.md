# Relocation Brief — Brussels, Belgium

## Client profile
Couple buying in Brussels with EUR 490,000-895,000 budget. Priorities: cafes and brunch, parks, and a quiet residential feel. Prefer 15-minute lifestyle with outdoor space and solid energy performance.

## Must-have
- Minimum 1 bedroom with 60+ sqm usable space.
- Private balcony or terrace for morning coffee.
- Within a 15-minute walk to a sizable park.
- Quiet street or rear-facing unit away from bar clusters.
- EPC rating C or better with double glazing.

## Nice-to-have
- South or west-facing outdoor space with good light.
- Elevator access if above the 3rd floor.
- Secure bike storage in the building.
- Parking option or easy street parking permit availability.
- Recent kitchen and bathroom updates with modern appliances.

## Red flags
- EPC rating E or worse indicating costly heating.
- Unapproved alterations lacking urban planning compliance documents.
- Persistent bar or tram noise audible inside with windows closed.
- High co-ownership arrears or legal disputes in the association.
- Announced roof, facade, or elevator works without a funded reserve.

## Trade-offs
- Quiet street preference versus living next to vibrant brunch spots.
- Historic charm versus better insulation from newer builds.
- Top-floor light and views versus reliance on an elevator.
- Large terrace desire versus tighter EPC and higher heating demand.
