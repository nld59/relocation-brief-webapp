# Relocation Brief — Brussels

## Client profile
Family of 3 relocating to Brussels, buying a 2+ bedroom apartment. Budget EUR 490k-895k. Priorities: safe and calm, parks within 15-minute walk, cafes and family-friendly streets.

## Must-have
- 2+ bedroom apartment with practical layout, good storage, and stroller-friendly elevator access.
- Safe, calm street away from heavy traffic noise.
- 15-minute walk to a playground or green park.
- Within 20-minute walk to Stepping Stone preschool.
- Private parking or a dedicated garage in the building.

## Nice-to-have
- South or west-facing balcony or terrace with daylight.
- Energy-efficient windows and modern heating for lower bills.
- Dedicated laundry space with ventilated utility area.
- Secure bike storage and stroller storage on ground level.

## Red flags
- Facade or roof works planned with unclear financing or high special assessments.
- Noticeable tram or arterial road noise inside with windows closed.
- EPC rating F or G indicating costly upgrades soon.
- Moisture or ventilation issues in bathrooms or underground cellars.
- Co-ownership disputes or unpaid building charges affecting resale and stability.

## Trade-offs
- Quieter tree-lined street may reduce immediate cafe choices nearby.
- Top-floor light and views may conflict with stroller-friendly access needs.
- Premium Woluwe addresses may compress budget for future renovations.
- Requiring private parking may narrow options near Tomberg or Place Wiener.

## Top-3 areas (shortlist)
### 1) Woluwe-Saint-Pierre

**Scorecard (1–5):** Safety:5 | Family:5 | Commute:5 | Lifestyle:4 | BudgetFit:4 | Overall:5

**Why:**

- Roodebeek metro area offers quick access plus playgrounds and errands within compact walking distances.

**Watch-out:**
- Some streets between Roodebeek and Tomberg feel car-heavy, so choose calmer interiors off arteries.

**Why:**
