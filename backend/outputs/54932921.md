# Relocation Brief — Brussels

## Client profile
Family with a 2-year-old buying in Brussels, seeking a 2+ room apartment. Budget EUR 490k-895k. Priorities: safe and calm streets, parks within 15-minute walk, cafes for weekend brunch.

## Must-have
- Minimum 2 bedrooms with child-friendly layout.
- Within a 15-minute walk of a park or playground.
- School or daycare reachable within a 20-minute walk.
- Quiet street away from major traffic arteries.
- Elevator or ground-floor access suitable for a stroller.

## Nice-to-have
- Balcony or terrace of at least 6 sqm.
- Energy label C or better for efficiency.
- Separate laundry or storage room for gear.
- Parking space or easy resident street parking.
- Within a 10-minute walk to metro or tram.

## Red flags
- On or overlooking a major road or tram depot.
- Poor sound insulation causing late-night noise from bars.
- No elevator for a unit above the 2nd floor.
- Pending facade or roof works without a funded reserve.
- Damp basement indications or known seepage risk zone.

## Trade-offs
- Premium communes increase safety and parks but can strain the budget.
- Top-floor light improves comfort but reduces stroller convenience without an elevator.
- Proximity to cafes raises vibrancy but may add evening noise.
- Older charm offers space but often worsens energy performance and insulation.
